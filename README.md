RDR3 related strings for hash conversion. I'll keep this up to date with a relatively clean reference (theoretically not too many useless strings or hash collisions). Most have been parsed from RDR3 decompiled scripts, past research contributions for GTA5 and prior, and much brute-force. I do need to clean this up further, but it's been mostly working well for me and revealed a lot of unknown hashes. However, I have procedurally generated many strings from known naming conventions and strings (i.e. many known texture names because they're plain-text in YTDs, like with "neckerchief_mr1_000_sbvb_right_c3_000_nm" I may have trimmed versions such as "neckerchief_mr1_000", because it's a common naming convention for drawables). So, undoubtedly there will be non-matches and there may be hash collisions, so if you see something that doesn't seem relevant at all, that's probably why.

Too many sources to credit individually from throughout the years, though the latest base came from dexyfex and their CodeX tool. I highly recommend CodeX and checking dexy out on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dexyfex/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/BxfKHkk).
