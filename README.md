RDR3 (Red Dead Redemption 2) related strings for JOAAT hash conversion. I'll keep this up to date and relatively clean. Most have been parsed from RDR3 decompiled scripts, sourced from past research contributions for GTA5, and much brute-force. I do need to clean this up further, but it's been mostly working well for me and revealed a lot of unknown hashes. However, I have also procedurally generated many strings from known naming conventions and strings (i.e. known texture names from plain-text in YTDs. For instance, with `neckerchief_mr1_000_sbvb_right_c3_000_nm` I may have trimmed versions such as `neckerchief_mr1_000`, because it's a common naming convention for drawables). So, undoubtedly there will be some non-matches and there may be hash collisions. If you see something that doesn't seem relevant at all, that might be why.

Too many sources to credit/know all, though the latest base came from dexyfex (updated with [CP's](https://github.com/cpmodding/Codex.Games.RDR2.strings/blob/main/Codex.Games.RDR2.strings.txt)) and their CodeX tool. I highly recommend CodeX and checking dexy out on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dexyfex/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/BxfKHkk). I also pull from Alex Guirre's [rage-parser-dumps](https://github.com/alexguirre/rage-parser-dumps).
